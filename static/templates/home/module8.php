          <p>In our research across a group of 183 clients, who had no
              experience modification reviews or claims assistance beyond what their broker
              provided, we discovered that at least 32% had significant claim discepancies within
              the last 7 years, while at least half of those, or about 16% in total, were refund
              eligible at the time. The remainder of the clients with significant claims discrepancies,
               those which were non-refund-eligible, had claims outside
              the window of opportunityâ€“as in they were carrier overcharges that were
              never addressed.</p>
