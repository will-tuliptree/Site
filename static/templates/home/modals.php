        <p> When a claim is made and the carrier overestimates the claim cost, we work to reduce teh estimate.
        </p>
        <p>
        When a claim is made, the carrier estimates how much it will cost them. Often times, the estimates are way off the mark.
        As an illustrative example, we have seen cases that should have been classified as first-aid reserved in the tens of
        thousands of dollars. By evaluating various reports, medical and otherwise, we gather justification for why a
        case does not merit high reserves. Then we file with the carrier to lower the reserve on these cases. This lower <thead>
        impact on your premium.

    <p>

        We study each case and become intimately familiar with its details. As representatives,
         we can act on this analysis to put money back in your company coffers. We have
         resources at our disposal that very few companies in New York possess, including
         in-house-developed software and vast knowledge of NYSIF procedures. If you are new in
          business or you are a business with a high experience modification rating, your
          rating must improve or be repaired before you can jump carriers. A low experience
          rating is as good as a “get-out-of-jail-free card” when you’re trapped with
        an expensive workers’ comp coverage policy, and we work very hard to get you that rating.

              meaning you have greater freedom to select the carrier that best suits your client.

            If your client is with the State Insurance Fund in the Assigned Risk Pool,
            then you are collecting no commission per NYSIF regulations and your client is
            probably paying a higher rate, due to a higher experience rating and lack of
            proper claims service. As representatives, we provide assistance with your
            client’s workers’ compensation policy in both claims and underwriting, for which we
            charge a service fee. If you make us representatives on the policy for either
            of our services, we will pay you for it. This means you can finally earn for
            Group 90 business, while you wait for us to ultimately help your client move
            outside NYSIF or to a commission-paying Safety Group. Alternatively,
            we can undertake a mod review for your client, for which you receive a fee.
