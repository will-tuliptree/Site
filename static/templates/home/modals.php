        <h3> REDUCING RESERVES</h3>
        <p> When a claim is made and the carrier overestimates the claim cost, we work to reduce teh estimate.
        </p>
        <p>
        When a claim is made, the carrier estimates how much it will cost them. Often times, the estimates are way off the mark.
        As an illustrative example, we have seen cases that should have been classified as first-aid reserved in the tens of
        thousands of dollars. By evaluating various reports, medical and otherwise, we gather justification for why a
        case does not merit high reserves. Then we file with the carrier to lower the reserve on these cases. This lower <thead>
        impact on your premium.
