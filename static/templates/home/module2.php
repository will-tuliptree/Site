        <p>Our experience has been in providing cradle-to-grave service on claims, requiring years of
            focus and follow through. Having consulted for clients outside our former safety groups,
            we created our organization with the knowledge that our hard work, individualized attention,
            and advocacy for our clients is exceptional, towering above the service provided by hundreds
            or thousands of faceless carrier drones, and is aggressively competitive with the few
            third-party representatives throughout New York. Realizing that there are thousands of
            unrepresented and underrepresented businesses in the State of New York alone, we saw an
            opportunity to help a great deal of managers,  administrators and owners save money and
            apply their will power
            to their business operations instead of workers’ comp headaches.
         </p>
         <h3> WHY TULIPTREE?</h3>
         <p>
             We have the deep resources, the advanced technical knowledge, and the experience at a
              better price than anyone else in New York State (all else being equal).
         </p>

         <p>
             Every company should have representation for workers’ comp claims and underwriting.
              The carrier often assesses accidents too high and usually does not go back and
              reconcile the assessment once the payments have been made and the case has been
              retired and closed. To us, this is abuse of the client. Most business owners
               would be shocked to know just how often this happens with claims
                (about 35% of the time, based on our research).
                 Getting representation is easy and will pay for itself several times
                  over for the average company with claims. If you want constant,
                  year-round service to maximize your savings and refunds,
                   and want to achieve the lowest experience modification rating possible,
                   we have a service for an ultra-low fee available. For a one-time premium
                   refund and experience modification review, we have a no-risk service available.
